# WhoTouchesMyCountryUIKit


same project and instructions as this one  [WhoTouchesMyCountrySUI link](https://github.com/AlexImml/WhoTouchesMyCountrySUI )
jist in UIKit insted of SwiftUI

all logic is copied form the SwiftUI proj.

notes: 

I tried to make is look as the SwiftUI project as much as posiible ( I think it looks better ). ( btw in swiftUI the blue is diffrent )

There are some inconsistencies: some comunications are with combine, some with blocks. some UI is progrematic, some are nibs. 
sometimes I used injection for the class testability and somtimes I dont ( honsetly a waste of code for this proj )

I did it just to show I know.
